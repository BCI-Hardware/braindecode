        If the module's forward method returns multiple outputs as a
        tuple, it is assumed that the first output contains the
        relevant information and the other values are ignored. If all
        values are relevant, consider using
        :func:`~skorch.NeuralNet.forward` instead.
        Parameters
        ----------
        X : input data, compatible with skorch.dataset.Dataset
          By default, you should be able to pass:
            * numpy arrays
            * torch tensors
            * pandas DataFrame or Series
            * scipy sparse CSR matrices
            * a dictionary of the former three
            * a list/tuple of the former three
            * a Dataset
          If this doesn't work with your data, you have to pass a
          ``Dataset`` that can deal with the data.
        Returns
        -------
        y_pred : numpy ndarray
        """
        y_preds = []
        for yp in self.forward_iter(X, training=False):
            yp = yp[0] if isinstance(yp, tuple) else yp
            y_preds.append(to_numpy(yp.max(-1)[-1]))
        y_pred = np.concatenate(y_preds, 0)
        return y_pred
