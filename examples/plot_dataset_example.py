=======
PyTorch-compatible braindecode dataset
======================================

In this example we show how to create a PyTorch-compatible Braindecode dataset 
along with preprocessing and windowing steps. More specifically we introduce two 
types of transformers:

1. raw transformers, that work on raw objects
2. window transformers, that work on numpy arrays representing windows

.. warning::
    This code will download subject 2 of the BCI competition IV 2a dataset via 
    moabb

# Define transformers that operate on raw objects
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# There are currently two types of transformers. Here, we define
# 1. the raw transformers that are applied first on continuous data
# 2. the windower that transforms raw data into epoched data
# 3. window transformers for processing steps applied on windowed data
#
# For demonstration purposes only, we apply filtering and normalization to both
# the raw and windowed data, however this shouldn't be done in practice.
#
# .. warning::
#
#    Don't do this at home!
#


# 1. raw transformers
# define band-pass filter to be used on raw data
filter_raw = FilterRaw(l_freq=1, h_freq=80)

# define zscore transformer for channel wise normalization
zscore_raw = ZscoreRaw()

# transformers can be chained in a list to be applied sequentially
raw_transforms = [filter_raw, zscore_raw]


# 2. window data
# define mapping for event windower
mapping = {1: "Left hand", 2: "Right hand", 3: "Foot", 4: "Tongue"}

# define event windower
event_windower = EventWindower(
    200, 200, True, tmin=0, mapping=mapping
)

# 2nd case
# fixed_length_windower = FixedLengthWindower(
#     window_size_samples=200, tmin=0, chunk_duration_samples=200, mapping=mapping)
# 3nd case
# windower = FixedLengthWindower(window_size_samples=None,
#                    overlap_size_samples=0)

# 3. window transformers
# define FIR filter for windowed data. The sampling frequency 'sfreq' has to be
# specified by the user as there is no information contained in the
# 'numpy.array' the filter later is applied to.
filter_window = FilterWindow(sfreq=250, l_freq=8, h_freq=12)

# zscore for normalization
zscore_window = ZscoreWindow()

# again, transformers can be chained in a list to be applied sequentially
window_transforms = [filter_window, zscore_window]
